Introduction
In the era of big data, the fields of data science and data mining have emerged as pivotal disciplines, each playing a crucial role in extracting insights from vast amounts of data. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent distinct methodologies and approaches to data analysis. This report aims to provide a comprehensive comparison between data science and data mining, elucidating their definitions, methodologies, applications, and differences.

Overview
Data science encompasses a broad range of techniques and methodologies aimed at extracting knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It incorporates various disciplines such as statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and domain knowledge to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in data.

On the other hand, data mining focuses specifically on the process of discovering patterns and relationships in large datasets through computational techniques. It involves methods such as clustering, classification, regression, and association rule mining to identify hidden patterns that can be used for decision-making and predictive modeling.

Description
Data Science
Data science involves the entire lifecycle of data analysis, starting from data collection and preprocessing to analysis, interpretation, and visualization. It employs statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and domain expertise to extract actionable insights from data. Data scientists utilize programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, along with various libraries and frameworks to manipulate and analyze data efficiently.

Data Mining
Data mining focuses on the process of uncovering patterns and relationships within datasets to extract useful information. It utilizes techniques such as clustering, classification, regression, and association rule mining to identify patterns that are not readily apparent. Data mining algorithms often work with large datasets to discover hidden insights that can be used for decision support and predictive modeling.
